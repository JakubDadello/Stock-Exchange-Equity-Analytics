# Polish-Equity-Analytics

## Project Description

This project analyzes the financial data of 370 Polish listed companies (GPW), taking into account sector-specific characteristics, to support investment decision-making. 

The goal is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts each company's investment rating (low, medium, or high) based on key financial indicators.

Developed a machine learning model to classify investment ratings of 370 publicly listed Polish companies based on financial indicators and sector-specific characteristics.

Built a complete data analysis and modeling pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to predict investment categories (low, medium, high).

Applied classification algorithms to identify patterns in financial data and support data-driven investment decision-making.

Although the dataset comes from companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the project demonstrates transferable data science and financial analysis skills. Financial indicators such as ROA, EBITDA, and leverage ratios are standardized worldwide, making the modeling approach applicable to global financial markets.


## How to Run

To run this project locally, you can use either Docker (recommended) or a standard Python environment.

### Using Docker 
* **Docker Compose:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build

* **Build the image:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t pqa_python_api .
* **Run the container:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name pqa_python_container pqa_python_api

### Using Python (Local Environment)
* **Install requirements:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
* **Launch FastAPI server:**
  ```bash
  uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

## Repository Structure
- `data/` - raw, labeled and preprocessed datasets (see `data/README.md`)
- `ETL/` - responsible for data extraction, joining financial tables, and initial cleaning before the machine learning phase.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing and modeling experiments
- `src/` - Python scripts for preprocessing data and training the final ML model
- `reports/` – Power BI dashboards and related analytics outputs
- `CRISP-DM.md` - detailed methodology workflow
- `airflow/` – optional workflow automation layer used for scheduling, orchestrating, and automating data processing and model training pipelines.
