# Polish-Equity-Analytics

## Project Description

This project analyzes the financial data of 370 Polish listed companies (GPW), taking into account sector-specific characteristics, to support investment decision-making. 

The goal is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts each company's investment rating (low, medium, or high) based on key financial indicators.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, you can use either Docker (recommended) or a standard Python environment.

### Using Docker 
* **Docker Compose:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build

* **Build the image:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t pqa_api.
* **Run the container:**
  ```bash
  docker run -p 8000:8000 pqa_container

### Using Python (Local Environment)
* **Install requirements:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
* **Launch FastAPI server:**
  ```bash
  uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
