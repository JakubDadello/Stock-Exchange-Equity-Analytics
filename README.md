# Polish-Equity-Analytics

## Project Description

Developed a machine learning model to classify investment ratings of 370 publicly listed Polish companies based on financial indicators and sector-specific characteristics.

Built a complete data analysis and modeling pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to predict investment categories (low, medium, high).

Although the dataset comes from companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the project demonstrates transferable data science and financial analysis skills. Financial indicators such as ROA, EBITDA, and leverage ratios are standardized worldwide, making the modeling approach applicable to global financial markets.


## How to Run

To run this project locally, you can use either Docker (recommended) or a standard Python environment.

### Using Docker 
* **Docker Compose:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build

* **Build the image:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t pqa_python_api .
* **Run the container:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name pqa_python_container pqa_python_api
